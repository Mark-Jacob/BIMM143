## Glucocorticoid Steroids

Downloaded BiocManager and DESeq2

``` r
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install()

# For this class, you'll also need DESeq2:
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
```

Importing the Airway counts and metadata

``` r
counts <- read.csv("airway_scaledcounts.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
metadata <-  read.csv("airway_metadata.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Viewing the data and defining how many genes there are.

``` r
nrow(counts)
```

    ## [1] 38694

``` r
nrow(metadata)
```

    ## [1] 8

``` r
# There are 38,694 genes in each experiment
# There are 8 experiments total, alternating between control and treament.
```

``` r
control <- metadata[metadata[,"dex"]=="control",]
control.mean <- rowSums( counts[ ,control$id] )/4 
names(control.mean) <- counts$ensgene
```
